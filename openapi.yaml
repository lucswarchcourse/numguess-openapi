  title: Number Guessing Game API
  description: |
    A RESTful API for a number guessing game.

    The game allows players to:
    - Create new game instances
    - Submit guesses for a number between 1 and 100
    - Track the number of guesses and best scores

    ## Richardson Maturity Model Level 3 (HATEOAS)

    This API implements **Level 3 of the Richardson Maturity Model** by providing comprehensive
    hypermedia controls in all JSON responses. Clients can navigate the entire API by following
    links, without hardcoding URLs or business logic about available actions.

    ### Hypermedia Format

    The API uses **HAL (Hypertext Application Language)** conventions with `_links` objects
    containing link relations. Supported media types:
    - `application/json` - JSON with embedded hypermedia controls
    - `application/hal+json` - Explicit HAL format
    - `application/xhtml+xml` - HTML forms (for browser interaction)

    ### Standard Link Relations

    All responses include a `_links` object with the following standard relations:

    - **self**: Link to the current resource
    - **games**: Link to the games collection
    - **create-game**: Action link to create a new game (POST)
    - **submit-guess**: Action link to submit a guess (POST) - only present when game is active
    - **new-game**: Action link to create a new game
    - **delete**: Action link to delete the current game (DELETE)
    - **root**: Link back to API root

    ### State-Driven Affordances

    Links are **contextual** and change based on application state:
    - Active games include `submit-guess` link
    - Completed games omit `submit-guess` link (game is won)
    - This enables clients to discover available actions without domain knowledge

    ### Client Benefits

    - **Discoverability**: Start at root (`/`) and follow links to navigate the API
    - **Decoupling**: No hardcoded URLs - server controls resource URIs
    - **Evolvability**: Server can change URLs without breaking clients
    - **Self-documentation**: Links include `method`, `type`, and `title` hints

    ### Example Client Flow

    ```
    1. GET /                    → Discover _links.games
    2. GET /games               → Discover _links.create-game
    3. POST /games              → Receive _links.self and _links.submit-guess
    4. POST /games/{uuid}       → Follow _links based on result
       - If game active: use _links.submit-guess to continue
       - If game won: use _links.new-game to play again
    ```

      summary: Submit a guess
      description: |
        Submits a guess for the specified game. The guess is compared against the secret number,
        and a result is returned indicating whether the guess was correct, too high, or too low.

        The response includes comprehensive hypermedia controls (Level 3 HATEOAS):
        - Current game state and guess result
        - Contextual action links based on game state:
          * If game is still active: link to submit another guess
          * If game is won: no submit-guess link (demonstrates state-driven affordances)
        - Navigation links to create new games or return to collection
        - Number of guesses made so far
        - Best score tracking across all games

        The hypermedia controls enable clients to navigate the application state without
        hardcoding URLs or business logic about when actions are available.

        should return 404, but deleting the same game multiple times has the same effect as deleting it once.
