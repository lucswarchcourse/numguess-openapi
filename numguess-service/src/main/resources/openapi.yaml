    A RESTful API for a number guessing game.

    The game allows players to:
    - Create new game instances
    - Submit guesses for a number between 1 and 100
    - Track the number of guesses and best scores

    ## Richardson Maturity Model Level 3 (HATEOAS)

    This API implements **Level 3 of the Richardson Maturity Model** by providing comprehensive
    hypermedia controls in all JSON responses. Clients can navigate the entire API by following
    links, without hardcoding URLs or business logic about available actions.

    ### Hypermedia Format

    The API uses **HAL (Hypertext Application Language)** conventions with `_links` objects
    containing link relations. Supported media types:
    - `application/json` - JSON with embedded hypermedia controls
    - `application/hal+json` - Explicit HAL format
    - `application/xhtml+xml` - HTML forms (for browser interaction)

    ### Standard Link Relations

    All responses include a `_links` object with the following standard relations:

    - **self**: Link to the current resource
    - **games**: Link to the games collection
    - **create-game**: Action link to create a new game (POST)
    - **submit-guess**: Action link to submit a guess (POST) - only present when game is active
    - **new-game**: Action link to create a new game
    - **delete**: Action link to delete the current game (DELETE)
    - **root**: Link back to API root

    ### State-Driven Affordances

    Links are **contextual** and change based on application state:
    - Active games include `submit-guess` link
    - Completed games omit `submit-guess` link (game is won)
    - This enables clients to discover available actions without domain knowledge

    ### Client Benefits

    - **Discoverability**: Start at root (`/`) and follow links to navigate the API
    - **Decoupling**: No hardcoded URLs - server controls resource URIs
    - **Evolvability**: Server can change URLs without breaking clients
    - **Self-documentation**: Links include `method`, `type`, and `title` hints

    ### Example Client Flow

    ```
    1. GET /                    → Discover _links.games
    2. GET /games               → Discover _links.create-game
    3. POST /games              → Receive _links.self and _links.submit-guess
    4. POST /games/{uuid}       → Follow _links based on result
       - If game active: use _links.submit-guess to continue
       - If game won: use _links.new-game to play again
    ```

        Returns the API root resource with hypermedia controls (Level 3 HATEOAS).
        This endpoint serves as the entry point to the API, providing discoverable links to all top-level resources.

        For HTML clients, may return HTTP 303 See Other redirect to `/games`.
        For JSON clients, returns hypermedia representation with navigational links.

        Creates a new number guessing game instance and returns hypermedia controls for interaction.
        The game is initialized with a random number between 1 and 100.
        A UUID is generated to uniquely identify the new game instance.

        Following Level 3 HATEOAS principles, the response includes comprehensive hypermedia links
        for all available actions: submitting guesses, deleting the game, or creating another game.

        Following REST principles, this operation is idempotent - deleting a non-existent game
        should return 404, but deleting the same game multiple times has the same effect as deleting it once.

        Returns a form (HTML) or game state representation with hypermedia controls (JSON).
        The game allows guessing numbers between 1 and 100.

        For JSON clients, provides full hypermedia controls including:
        - Link to submit a guess (if game is still active)
        - Link to delete the game
        - Navigation links to related resources
        - Current game state information

        This enables client discoverability of available actions (Level 3 HATEOAS).

        Submits a guess for the specified game. The guess is compared against the secret number,
        and a result is returned indicating whether the guess was correct, too high, or too low.

        The response includes comprehensive hypermedia controls (Level 3 HATEOAS):
        - Current game state and guess result
        - Contextual action links based on game state:
          * If game is still active: link to submit another guess
          * If game is won: no submit-guess link (demonstrates state-driven affordances)
        - Navigation links to create new games or return to collection
        - Number of guesses made so far
        - Best score tracking across all games

        The hypermedia controls enable clients to navigate the application state without
        hardcoding URLs or business logic about when actions are available.
